## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to design and implement buttons with a neon aesthetic and interactive hover effects, using only HTML and CSS (and optionally JavaScript for extended interactivity). These buttons are ideal for modern, creative, or portfolio websites where visual impact is important.

## Key Features

- **Neon Aesthetic:** Utilizes CSS variables and custom properties to create bright, glowing button effects.
- **Interactive Hover Effects:** Buttons respond to user interaction with smooth color transitions and glow enhancements.
- **Responsive Layout:** The example layout centers the buttons both vertically and horizontally.
- **Font Awesome Integration:** (Based on sample HTML) Icons can be displayed inside buttons for added visual cues.
- **Reusable CSS Classes:** Button styles are encapsulated in reusable classes, making it easy to apply the neon effect to any link or button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For semantic structure and button layout.
- **CSS3:** For styling, custom properties, transitions, and glow effects.
  - Uses CSS variables for easy color and transition management.
  - Box-shadow and border techniques for the neon glow.
- **(Optional) JavaScript:** Referenced for potential extended interactivity (e.g., `js/script.js`), though the core neon effects are CSS-driven.
- **Font Awesome:** For button icons (as seen in the HTML example).



## Noteworthy Aspects

- **Simplicity & Appeal:** Achieves a modern neon look with minimal code and no dependencies beyond CSS and optional icon fonts.
- **Customization Ready:** Easily adaptable to different color schemes by changing CSS variables.
- **Great for Portfolios & Landing Pages:** Ideal for developers/designers wanting to showcase interactive UI elements.
